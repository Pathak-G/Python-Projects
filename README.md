# Python-Projects
This Inventory management system is created using python 
programming. The program can be ran on any python supported IDE. 
Firstly the program displays all the products and their details that are 
already available in the inventory. The program allows user to search 
the product by entering product number (ID). The program also allows 
user to add new products into the inventory by adding product details 
as mentioned above in the report. Once user has provided all the 
required product details, the program then displays the updated 
inventory having the new product introduced by the user. User can 
also delete product details just by entering the product number.
